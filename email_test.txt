Dear Kritiga,

Hope to find you in good health.

I have been working on the UI of an application for the past three days
but accidently my PC got formatted resulting in file lost.

Fortunately I have a backup in the office server.

Could you please do me a favour in helping me find my backup files.

Thanks & Regards
Md Aquib Shahab
